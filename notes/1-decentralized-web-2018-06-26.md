# Data. Together. Let's read about it

## 1: A view on the decentralized (distributed) web (June 26)

### Intro

Just getting us all on the same page about this very, er, central question, and also working through distinctions between similar terms (especially) decentralized, distributed, federated, p2p).

**Readings**

- Brewster Kahle: [Locking the Web Open, a Call for a Distributed Web](http://brewster.kahle.org/2015/04/22/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web/) or [Locking the Web Open: A Call for a Decentralized Web (longer form)](http://brewster.kahle.org/2015/08/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web-2/)
- André Staltz ["The Web Began Dying in 2014, Here's How"](https://staltz.com/the-web-began-dying-in-2014-heres-how.html)
- [Baran, P. (1964). _On Distributed Communications_ (No. RM-4230-PR). Santa Monica, CA: Rand Corporation.](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM3420.html)

### Themes

- What's the relationship between the Brewster Kahle vision of 2015 and where we are today? 
- To what extent can the "Trinet" be destabilized? That is, what forces would be required to craft a different future for the Net?
- What are the motivations in each of these different moments of distriuted enthusiasm?
- how are they using "web" and "internet"? 
- can we talk about decentralized vs. distributed?
- Lessig's "code is law". how do we think about social values & technical systems, and the relationship to distributed systems?
- Code is culture as well, what kind of cultural impact will a distributed system have?
- example: is bitcoin or etherium "distributed"? not if you're offline.  So maybe "distributed" has different levels of meaning/nuances
- can we talk about patchwork/ssb? Designing for non-1%ers; and how expectations shift as the platform grows. 

### Notes

- Each reading provides a snapshot of a moment of enthusiasm about decentralization
- A start: (chronologically) Visions of the web, as Brewster Kahle references. What are the values under visions under the web
    - connection between tech and the values
- Framings:
    - Baran: Resiliency from Attack
    - Kahle: Juridical Speech
    - Staltz: Access (Equity)
- Subject position (and value systems) needs to be accounted for when arguing for a view
- Values need to be based on context of use (e.g., example of Mobile Users, Facebook bottom line, Dapps and IPFS)
- Infrastructure, behaviour, flow entangled in such a way you could decentralize and it wouldn't effect many types of change. 
- Seeing/operating at scales (and "levels of distribution"):
    - large corporations cannot control at the small scale (but increasingly through software are to)
- hidden pockets of communities burrowing away from the panopticon
- Re-centreing on important things: "what's the point" point
- Where do we focus our attention for change?
    - Nation-state?
    - Economic (market?)
- Key questions: "what are we trying to do here, what are the outcomes we're trying to achieve"
- Decentralization has a history prior to communications networks. (e.g. which one is Ostrom drawing on?)
- Decentralization and disintermediation
- How to hold space with contradictory values
    - Pluralist 
    - Change as a constant
    - "Build systems for these condradictions"
- Two sets of types of effort: building techincal systems, building society, building society to build that system
- **Provisional answer to what we are trying to accomplish in this reading group:**
    - **Does distributed move us toward a shared set of values?**
    - **And what are those shared sets of values**

#### Submarine Cables

“Large content providers have huge and often unpredictable traffic requirements, especially among their own data centers. Their capacity needs are at such a scale that it makes sense for them, on their biggest routes, to build rather than to buy. Owning subsea fibre pairs also gives them the flexibility to upgrade when they see fit, rather than being beholden to a third-party submarine cable operator.”

### Chat Log

Matt Price [03:33 PM]: https://hackmd.io/oEcuKALCTi-PbawLmT_Ixw?edit who does mtt Z keep smiling about that?  
Matt Price [03:47 PM]: in case there's anyone who doesn't have the notes link yet: https://hackmd.io/oEcuKALCTi-PbawLmT_Ixw?edit  
jccahill [03:49 PM]: patchwork as case study?  
b5 [03:52 PM]: +100000  
dcwalk [03:55 PM]: John Perry Barlow  
Matt Price [03:55 PM]: yes exactly!  
jccahill [03:56 PM]: constant between-groups and within-groups abrogation of norms is a major reason why i research memes  
Matt Price [03:56 PM]: nice.  
jccahill [03:59 PM]: does zoom actually have a "raise hand" function, like jitsi meet and others? don't see it  
b5 [03:59 PM]: yep! it’s in the participants tab  
Matt Price [04:01 PM]: what I said was a little simplistic.  I have expressed this kind of critique in thepast.  But I still sort of believed i nthe emancipatory possibilities of hte web. But I'm not sure I still do.  
dcwalk [04:02 PM]: Yeah Matt, something about emancipatory potential is what grabs b5 too :]: Matt Price [04:04 PM]: my connection is a little unstable.  so I may disappear.  
dcwalk [04:04 PM]: I can hold stack if you drop off Matt P.  
jccahill: when you use the word “patch” are you drawing on something/someone? I think like ecosystems theory and patch dynamics  
Matt Price [04:09 PM]: rob next  
b5 [04:09 PM]: then b5?  
Matt Price [04:09 PM]: I want to be sure to cob5 back to this "what's the point" question.  
dcwalk [04:09 PM]: +1 Matt P.  
Matt Price [04:09 PM]: rob, then b5  
dcwalk [04:10 PM]: This feels to b5 like both a co-option and move of like… entrenchment  
dcwalk [04:10 PM]: Yeah! The it is a joint OCAD thing with the folks at New Museum  
Matt Price [04:14 PM]: flagging the question of the "corporate environment" and the relationship between technology, democracy, and capital.  
jccahill [04:14 PM]: re: centralization of the bottom of the networking model, now archivists have to start trying to account for eu-mandated internetwide snooping  
Matt Price [04:15 PM]: comes back to the "levels of distribution" point matt z at the very beginning.  
dcwalk [04:16 PM]: yeah, there is something really helpful about thinking across scales!  
Matt Price [04:17 PM]: jeremy next. @b5 can you explicitly say how freedom of association is enhanced by distributed networks?   
hi mhz!  
dcwalk [04:19 PM]: Hi mhz!  
Michelle Hertzfeld [04:19 PM]: :waves:  
Matt Price [04:21 PM]: ... nazi discussion...  
dcwalk [04:23 PM]: I think I can’t use the put up my hand feature, but can I jump on stack  
Hahahah tomes has a homeserver  
dcwalk [04:24 PM]: love it — think we mentioned something about federation in a future session  
b5 [04:25 PM]: remember microsoft  
jccahill [04:25 PM]: >implying it still isn't. does "locking the web open" without changing the 90-9-1 distribution actually lock it open  
Matt Price [04:27 PM]: ^^. putting myself on stack.  
b5 [04:30 PM]: to answer above, “freedom of association” in the sense of being able to explicitly choose who I connect with in the p2p sense. By being able to choose who I connect to and get content from.  
dcwalk [04:32 PM]: Yeah, so stuck on this. Donella Meadows has this short article “Leverage Points: Ways to intervene in a System"  
this is my systems thinking quals showing thru  
mash [04:33 PM]: perhaps individual countries don’t have as much power but what about things like the recent EU copyright directive  
dcwalk [04:34 PM]: No I was just gonna say “can we have a sentence of context”  
Michelle Hertzfeld [04:34 PM]: That would be lovely :)   
Matt Price [04:35 PM]: 30 minutes left.  
b5 [04:35 PM]: so agreed, nation stats & the web are…. a tangled story.  
Matt Price [04:35 PM]: what do we want to make sure we talk about?  
dcwalk [04:37 PM]: Not necessarily, I’m just saying that I take it up in this context  
Matt Price [04:37 PM]: sorry, zoom is using like 300% of cpu in like 87 threads.  
b5 [04:37 PM]: I think rob’s next  
Michelle Hertzfeld [04:38 PM]: The "what are we trying to do here, what are the outcomes we're trying to achieve" -- yeah, that totally makes sense  
b5 [04:39 PM]: jeremy next  
dcwalk [04:39 PM]: Jeremy on stack for next?  
jccahill [04:39 PM]: thx  
Michelle Hertzfeld [04:40 PM]: Talking past each other without clear articulation of outcomes = almost every open source project ever :-/  
b5 [04:42 PM]: feels like the intersection of “systems design” in the technical sense and a “value system”  
matt p next  
dcwalk [04:46 PM]: I feel like we have a floating moderation that I’m really digging rn  
jccahill [04:46 PM]: >how do you build a society that you'd want to live in   >that hasn't been done yet  
jccahill [04:46 PM]: matt doesn't live in a society  
dcwalk [04:46 PM]: “tech lash” can I jump up next  
Matt Zumwalt [04:48 PM]: then me!  
Matt Price [04:49 PM]: ... matt p, pretending to be the moderator again. 9 minutes.  
dcwalk [(null)]: I’ll dig up the Eve Tuck letter (it is very readable!]:   
Matt Price [(null)]: I think there of the haitian revolution.  
dcwalk [04:53 PM]: perfect hand off to talking about memes?  
Matt Price [04:53 PM]: its relationship to the fr revn, which was different form its relationship to the napoleonic empire!  
mash [04:54 PM]: this kind of experimentation is pretty much what Facebook is doing, incrementally  
b5 [04:54 PM]: the “problem group"  
dcwalk [04:54 PM]: Yo, I just re-read the Dispossessed and I’m like all full of thinking about Odonism  
jccahill [04:54 PM]: fwiw "meb5 studies" is a totally syncretic new attempt at a field and we have been thinking about how a reading group would work  
dcwalk [04:55 PM]: jccahill: can you share links in that notes?  
Super interested! I love Geert Lovink’s principles of meb5 design  
Matt Zumwalt [04:56 PM]: https://github.com/datatogether/reading-data-together  
jccahill [04:56 PM]: dawn: we're building a research library. there's a grouplib on zotero and an omeka site going up. will be able to link soonish  
dcwalk [04:57 PM]: Please!  
b5 [04:58 PM]: yes so much! I’d love to see sob5 of Jermey’s suggestions land in there :]:   
Matt Price [04:59 PM]: feels more practical  
Matt Zumwalt [05:00 PM]: coordination is happening in this GitHub repo: https://github.com/datatogether/reading-data-together  
dcwalk [05:01 PM]: Thank you Matt P. for moderating!!!!!!!!!  
Michelle Hertzfeld [05:01 PM]: Thx for filling b5 in, the late arrival! Thx, all!!  
jccahill [05:01 PM]: thanks all  
mash [05:01 PM]: thank you, this was very interesting  
jccahill [05:01 PM]: apologies to all slacks-wearers
